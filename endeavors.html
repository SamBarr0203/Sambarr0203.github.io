                <p>I’m currently a cybersecurity student at Trevecca Nazarene University, preparing to graduate soon. Alongside my studies, I’m interning with a healthcare company called Skin Clique as a Cloud Intern, where I’m helping improve their security posture through assessment, remediation, and collaborative work with their IT and security teams. I'm also actively preparing for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification exam. I’ve completed over 70 hours of focused study, including the full CompTIA Security+ Guide by Mike Chapple and David Seidl, and I’m currently working through the Udemy course by Jason Dion. I aim to take the exam shortly after graduation, dedicating about an hour each day to studying when possible. In addition, I’m refining personal projects like my AWS security dashboard and Microsoft 365/Entra security checklist, which help demonstrate my hands-on learning and interest in cloud security best practices.</p>

            <h1>Looking Forward</h1>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>After graduating, I aspire to land a role as a junior cybersecurity analyst, ideally focusing on cloud security. I'm looking forward to earning my Security+ certification and eventually pursuing advanced certifications like AWS Certified Security – Specialty. I also hope to attend cybersecurity conferences like DEF CON to network and learn from industry experts. On a personal note, I'd love to travel to Europe with my girlfriend to celebrate my graduation.</p>

            <h1>Further Studies</h1>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>I'm deeply invested in my Security+ certification training, which I’m 65% through as part of my preparation for a career in cybersecurity. I'm taking a comprehensive Udemy course titled "CompTIA Security+ Certification (SY0-601): The Total Course" to build my foundational knowledge. To supplement my learning, I purchased the book "CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-601 Study Guide" by Darril Gibson, which has been an excellent resource for practice questions and in-depth explanations. So far, I've dedicated over 50 hours to studying, including practice exams, labs, and reading, to ensure I’m well-prepared for the exam.</p>
