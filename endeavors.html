                <p>As a cybersecurity student at Trevecca Nazarene University, I'm currently focusing on preparing for my Security+ certification, which I'm 65% through studying for. I'm also working on a cloud security project, exploring AWS services like GuardDuty to enhance my skills in threat detection. Additionally, I'm balancing my studies with my role as a collegiate soccer player, which keeps me disciplined and team-oriented.</p>

                <p>After graduating, I aspire to land a role as a junior cybersecurity analyst, ideally focusing on cloud security. I'm looking forward to earning my Security+ certification and eventually pursuing advanced certifications like AWS Certified Security – Specialty. I also hope to attend cybersecurity conferences like DEF CON to network and learn from industry experts. On a personal note, I'd love to travel to Europe with my girlfriend to celebrate my graduation.</p>

                <p>I'm deeply invested in my Security+ certification training, which I’m 65% through as part of my preparation for a career in cybersecurity. I'm taking a comprehensive Udemy course titled "CompTIA Security+ Certification (SY0-601): The Total Course" to build my foundational knowledge. To supplement my learning, I purchased the book "CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-601 Study Guide" by Darril Gibson, which has been an excellent resource for practice questions and in-depth explanations. So far, I've dedicated over 50 hours to studying, including practice exams, labs, and reading, to ensure I’m well-prepared for the exam.</p>
