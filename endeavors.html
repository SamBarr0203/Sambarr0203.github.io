                <p>As a cybersecurity student at Trevecca Nazarene University, I'm currently focusing on preparing for my Security+ certification, which I'm 65% through studying for. I'm also working on a cloud security project, exploring AWS services like GuardDuty to enhance my skills in threat detection. Additionally, I'm balancing my studies with my role as a collegiate soccer player, which keeps me disciplined and team-oriented.</p>
