                <p>I’m currently a cybersecurity student at Trevecca Nazarene University, preparing to graduate soon. Alongside my studies, I’m interning with a healthcare company called Skin Clique as a Cloud Intern, where I’m helping improve their security posture through assessment, remediation, and collaborative work with their IT and security teams. I'm also actively preparing for the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification exam. I’ve completed over 70 hours of focused study, including the full CompTIA Security+ Guide by Mike Chapple and David Seidl, and I’m currently working through the Udemy course by Jason Dion. I aim to take the exam shortly after graduation, dedicating about an hour each day to studying when possible. In addition, I’m refining personal projects like my AWS security dashboard and Microsoft 365/Entra security checklist, which help demonstrate my hands-on learning and interest in cloud security best practices.</p>

                <p>As I approach graduation, I’m excited to begin my career in cybersecurity starting with a goal of becoming a Junior Cybersecurity Analyst. While cybersecurity remains the foundation of my path, I’m especially drawn to the cloud side of the industry, and I’m eager to work in environments like AWS and Azure that are shaping the future of secure infrastructure. In the near term, I plan to earn my CompTIA Security+ certification to solidify my core knowledge, then pursue additional certifications such as CompTIA Cloud+, AWS, and Microsoft Azure credentials to deepen my skills in cloud infrastructure and security. Long-term, I want to join a team where I can collaborate with experts, solve real-world challenges, and grow through experience. My goal is to stay adaptable, continue learning, and make meaningful contributions in both cybersecurity and cloud environments.</p>
