            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Sam Barrionuevo! I’m currently a cybersecurity student at Trevecca Nazarene University with a passion for protecting company data and solving real-world problems. I have hands-on experience with AWS and Azure infrastructure, and I love learning by doing. This website is my latest project - feel free to explore my LinkedIn, current work, and the projects I’ve been working on. Welcome to my portfolio!</p>

                <h2>Soccer and Cybersecurity</h2>
                <div class="text-box">
                    <p>Throughout my time at Trevecca Nazarene University, I had the unique opportunity to play on the men’s soccer team on an athletic scholarship while pursuing my degree in cybersecurity. Balancing the demands of collegiate athletics with a rigorous academic program taught me more than just how to manage my time; it helped shape my character and work ethic. Maintaining a 3.8 GPA while training, traveling, and competing at a high level required discipline, focus, and resilience. The lessons I learned on the field—teamwork, accountability, communication, and perseverance carried over into the classroom and my cybersecurity studies. I’ve learned how to handle pressure, adapt to changing situations, and stay committed even when schedules are tight or challenges arise. The ability to push through tough practices and long nights of studying has prepared me for the demands of a cybersecurity career. I believe that my background in athletics has strengthened not only my technical skills, but also my mindset giving me the tools to thrive in collaborative, high-stakes environments.</p>
